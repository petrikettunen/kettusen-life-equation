# The Kettunen Life Equation

**The Kettunen Life Equation** is a philosophical model developed by **Petri Kettunen**.

It describes life as a probability-based state transition system, where outcomes emerge from chains of events and choices rather than single actions.

---

## Core Idea

Life does not unfold as a fixed destiny or a linear cause–effect chain.

Instead, it evolves through successive life states, where each event and decision modifies the probability landscape of future outcomes.

Outcomes are not guaranteed — they become more or less likely.

## Formal Structure

### Outcome Probability

The probability of a life outcome **T** emerges from all possible paths leading to it:

P(T) = Σ (over paths) Π P(eᵢ | Sᵢ, aᵢ, Mᵢ, Hᵢ, Eᵢ, Cᵢ)

Where:

- **T** = life outcome or resulting state
- **eᵢ** = event
- **Sᵢ** = current life state
- **aᵢ** = choice or action
- **Mᵢ** = memory and past experience
- **Hᵢ** = habits and behavioral patterns
- **Eᵢ** = environment
- **Cᵢ** = constraints (physical, psychological, social)

### Life State Transition

Life progresses from one state to another through a transition function:

Sᵢ₊₁ = F(Sᵢ, eᵢ, aᵢ, Mᵢ, Hᵢ, Eᵢ, Cᵢ)

The function **F** is intentionally undefined.

Human life cannot be reduced to a fixed deterministic function without misrepresentation.

## Interpretation

- The model is **not deterministic**
- It is **not predictive**
- It is **not a scientific law**

It is a descriptive and conceptual framework for understanding how choices, context, memory, and constraints shape future possibilities.

---

## Relation to Chaos Theory

While the model shares surface similarities with the butterfly effect, it differs fundamentally.

Chaos theory describes deterministic systems without agency.

**The Kettunen Life Equation explicitly includes choice, memory, and adaptation.**

---

## Scope and Limitations

- Philosophical, not empirical
- Not falsifiable in the scientific sense
- Not intended for numerical simulation or prediction

Its value lies in structuring thought, not calculation.
